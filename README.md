# Off Canvas Mobile Menu for Sage 9

This code implements a simple off canvas mobile menu that can be used in your
Sage 9 projects.  It is based on an [off canvass tutitorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_off-canvas.asp)
from W3 Schools and requires the [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework.

The project consists of four files.  There are two view files, one JavaScript file, and one SCSS file.
These files are not meant to override your existing files.  Only to show you where you can add the snippets contained in them.
For clarity, I have added each file in it's appropriate Sage 9 folder.
